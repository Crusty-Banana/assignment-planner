              <p>Podcasts generally fall into two categories: storytelling and interviewing. Even in the same topic, each category will have slightly different ways of developing content and writing scripts. Below are some suggestions for both types. </p>\
              <p>For a storytelling podcast: </p>\
              <ul> \
              <li> Find any flow problems in your script by reading it aloud. Use this as an opportunity to see if your script fits within your time constraints.</li>\
              <li> Have another person edit the script or consult your mentor. Seeking an outside view can assist in identifying story holes or other problems you might not have anticipated.</li>\
              </ul> \
              <p>For an interview podcast, consider creating an outline or set of questions in advance: </p> \
              <ul> \
              <li> Are you going to host one guest one or more? </li>\
              <li> Will this interview be conducted remotely, or are your guests present in the same room as you? </li>\
              <li> Before the interview, will you email the questions to your guests? Be aware that if you give your visitors the exact questions in advance, their responses may sound prepared, and the atmosphere may become less natural. </li>\
              <li> Consider providing a general outline of the interview for the guest. </li>\
              <li> Make sure your guests are aware that the recording will be edited. It can be polite to inform them if you have to eliminate any parts of the interview so that nobody is misrepresented or misunderstood. </li>\

    <p>Podcasts generally fall into two categories: storytelling and interviewing. Even in the same topic, each category will have slightly different ways of developing content and writing scripts. Below are some suggestions for both types. </p>\
    <p>For a storytelling podcast: </p>\
    <ul> \
    <li> Find any flow problems in your script by reading it aloud. Use this as an opportunity to see if your script fits within your time constraints.</li>\
    <li> Have another person edit the script or consult your mentor. Seeking an outside view can assist in identifying story holes or other problems you might not have anticipated.</li>\
    </ul> \
    <p>For an interview podcast, consider creating an outline or set of questions in advance: </p> \
    <ul> \
    <li> Are you going to host one guest one or more? </li>\
    <li> Will this interview be conducted remotely, or are your guests present in the same room as you? </li>\
    <li> Before the interview, will you email the questions to your guests? Be aware that if you give your visitors the exact questions in advance, their responses may sound prepared, and the atmosphere may become less natural. </li>\
    <li> Consider providing a general outline of the interview for the guest. </li>\
    <li> Make sure your guests are aware that the recording will be edited. It can be polite to inform them if you have to eliminate any parts of the interview so that nobody is misrepresented or misunderstood. </li>\

    <p><strong>B. Pen to paper</strong></p>\
